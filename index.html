    			<p>I don't care if Monday's blue<br>
                Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too<br>
                Thursday I don't care about you<br>
                It's Friday, I'm in love</p>
                <p>Monday you can fall apart<br>
                Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart<br>
                Oh, Thursday doesn't even start<br>
                It's Friday, I'm in love</p>

                <p>Saturday, wait<br>
                And Sunday always comes too late<br>
                But Friday, never hesitate...</p>

                <p>I don't care if Monday's black<br>
                Tuesday, Wednesday - heart attack<br>
                Thursday, never looking back<br>
                It's Friday, I'm in love</p>

                <p>Monday, you can hold your head<br>
                 Tuesday, Wednesday stay in bed<br>
                Or Thursday - watch the walls instead<br>
                It's Friday, I'm in love</p>

                <p>Saturday, wait<br>
                And Sunday always comes too late<br>
                But Friday, never hesitate...</p>

                <p>Dressed up to the eyes<br>
                It's a wonderful surprise<br>
                To see your shoes and your spirits rise<br>
                Throwing out your frown<br>
                And just smiling at the sound<br>
                And as sleek as a sheik<br>
                Spinning round and round<br>
                Always take a big bite<br>
                It's such a gorgeous sight<br>
                To see you eat in the middle of the night<br>
                You can never get enough<br>
                Enough of this stuff<br>
                It's Friday, I'm in love</p>


                <p>I don't care if Monday's blue<br>
                Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too<br>
                Thursday I don't care about you<br>
                It's Friday, I'm in love</p>


                <p>Monday you can fall apart<br>
                Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart<br>
                Thursday doesn't even start<br>
